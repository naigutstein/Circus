       Meet Henry the clown! Henry has two eyes, eyebrows, a nose, a mouth. Henry loves giving candy to kids at the circus so he always keeps some near by. Currently, Henry has some candy around him on the ground (two red fruit snacks and two tootsie rolls).  

       Try moving to see a different view of Henry. You can move up by pressing the up-arrow key, down by pressing the down-arrow key, to the right by pressing the right-arrow key, and left by pressing the left-arrow key. To turn to the right press the "d" key and to turn to the left press the "a" key. To move forward press the "w" key and to move backward press the "s" key.

       Try adjusting Henry's mouth by pressing keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Depending on which key you press, a section of Henry's mouth with adjust. As you increase key number pressed, the next right segment of Henry's mouth is adjusted. So, pressing key 1 will adjust the left-most segment of Henry's mouth, which pressing key 6 will adjust the right-most segment of Henry's mouth.
